You can regenerate the test data by running:
./form_test_json.py --host HOSTNAME

This will fetch data from Candlepin and convert to splice.common.models.{Product, Pool, Rules}
Next it outputs those converted models to their own .json file
 - products.json
 - rules.json
 - pools.json


Below scripts will read in the above sample .json files and use curl to upload to Splice
./upload_pools.sh
./upload_products.sh
./upload_rules.sh
