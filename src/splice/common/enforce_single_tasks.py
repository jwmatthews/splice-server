# This class will use 2 ways of accessing MongoDB
# 1) mongoengine - used primarily to save 'SingleTaskInfo' objects to Mongo
# 2) pymongo     - used to invoke an atomic operation 'find_and_modify' which mongoengine does not expose
#
# We form the connection through pymongo by asking mongoengine's SingleTaskInfo for the pymongo collection it is using
# next we defer the lookup of this pymongo collection until we are servicing the method, this helps to ensure we use
# the same connection to pymongo.  This is needed if some init code changes the DB info after loading classes, like
# what we see when running unit tests
