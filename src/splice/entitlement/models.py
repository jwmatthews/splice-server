# Overview of what functionality will need to be supported:
# 1) A splice-consumer will checkin with us and pass us: identifier + installed engineering products
#    We will need to:
#    - convert engineering products + identifier to marketing products
#    - determine if identifier is allowed to access marketing products
#    - request entitlement certificate for allowed engineering products
#    - record usage of marketing products
# 2) A splice-server will contact us to ask if we know of a consumer identity
#    We will need to:
#    - check our database to determine if consumer identity is known
#      - if known, return the subscription information for the identity
#    - query our parent for the identity information
# 3) A splice-server will contact us to upload their reporting information
#    We will need to:
#    - accept reporting data, aggregate it with our own data and
#      keep track of path of usage through splice servers
# 4) Be able to import consumer identity information from a file based export or other splice-server
#
# Thoughts/Questions
#  - How does a SpliceServer bootstrap itself on initial setup?
#       - Would the top level entity issue a certificate with a splice server UUID
#       on first-initialization certificate is parsed to determine splice-server UUID
#
#       OR
#
#       - Do we go with a more decentralized approach, where we create our own uuid, then propogate this UUID
#       and the parent/child chain information with our reporting data?
#           Question is from the perspective when we are looking at the reporting data, how do we determine where
#           the usage came from.  Do we look at the chain of parent-child-child-...  or do we assume a splice-server
#           UUID is sufficient?
